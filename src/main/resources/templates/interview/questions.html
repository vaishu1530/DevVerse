<h2>Important C Language Interview Questions</h2>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q1. What is C language?</strong>
    <p>A procedural programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 used for system and application development.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q2. What are the features of C language?</strong>
    <p>Fast, low-level memory access, structured language, portable, supports pointers and functions.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q3. What is the difference between call by value and call by reference?</strong>
    <p>Call by value copies the value. Call by reference shares the address, so original value can be modified.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q4. What is a pointer?</strong>
    <p>A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q5. What is the difference between malloc() and calloc()?</strong>
    <p>malloc() allocates memory without initialization; calloc() allocates and initializes to zero.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q6. What is a dangling pointer?</strong>
    <p>A pointer that refers to a memory location that has been freed or deleted.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q7. What is recursion in C?</strong>
    <p>A function calling itself repeatedly until a base condition is met.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q8. What is the purpose of the static keyword?</strong>
    <p>It preserves the value of a variable across function calls or restricts scope within a file.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q9. What are storage classes in C?</strong>
    <p>auto, register, static, and extern — they define scope, visibility, and lifetime of variables.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q10. Difference between structure and union?</strong>
    <p>In structures, each member has its own storage; in unions, all members share the same memory.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q11. What is the use of sizeof() operator?</strong>
    <p>Returns the size (in bytes) of a data type or variable.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q12. What is a segmentation fault?</strong>
    <p>An error caused by accessing memory that the program doesn’t own (e.g., dereferencing a NULL pointer).</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q13. What are header files?</strong>
    <p>Files with `.h` extension that contain function declarations and macro definitions.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q14. Explain the use of `const` keyword.</strong>
    <p>Makes a variable value unchangeable after initialization.</p>
</div>

<div class="question-box">
    <strong>Q15. What is command line argument?</strong>
    <p>Parameters passed to the main function via `int main(int argc, char *argv[])` from the command line.</p>
</div>
